                THE BRIEF
              </h3>
              <p>
                "The Second Bakery Attack" (Japanese: パン屋再襲撃, Hepburn: Pan'ya Saishūgeki) 
                is a short story by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami">Haruki Murakami</a>, 
                originally published in the August 1985 
                issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Claire">Marie Claire</a> Japan. 
                It is a sequel to Murakami's short story "Bakery Attack", 
                which was published in 1981. <br> In 1986, "The Second Bakery Attack" was included in 
                a short story collection of the same name. The story was later translated into 
                English by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rubin">Jay Rubin</a> and 
                published in the January 1992 issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy">Playboy</a>. 
                In 1993, Rubin's translation was included in the collection 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_Vanishes">The Elephant Vanishes</a>.<br> 
                (Wikipedia) <br>
                <br>
                The story is told by the same character from the
                original “Bakery Attack”, now older and recently
                married. One night, both he and his wife get
                unbearably hungry to the point they can not sleep.
                Unfortunately, they have little food in their refrigerator.
                Despite eating it all, the urgent hunger would not go
                away. In that moment, the man has a memory from his
                past, and he recounts to his wife when he had the
                exact same feeling with his friend, that time when they
                decide to robber a bakery, ten years ago.<br>
                The two intended to take all the bread, but the man
                who ran the bakery offers a counterproposal: since
                he is a Wagener fanatic, if they listen to <i>Tannhäuser
                and The Flying Dutchman</i> with him in the bakery,
                he will give them all the bread they needed. <br>
                <br>
                After hearing that story, the woman suggests to do the
                same thing. However, they can not find an open bakery
                that late at night, so they decide to robber
                a McDonald's instead. With ski masks on and
                an automatic shotgun, they enter the shop and demand
                thirty Big Macs. <br> After a discussion with the employees,
                the couple receive what they asked for, they drive away
                until they find an empty parking lot and eat until full. <br>
                Finally the hunger is gone. 
    
                From a close reading of Murakami's text we had to choose a particular theme or topic 
                to explore in the creation of an artwork.

            PREVIOUS ANALYSIS
          </h3>
          <p>
            Even if at first it may seem just a crazy story, after
            a preliminary research about the contest in which it was
            written, the author's ideas regarding the story and the
            analysis conducted on the text, it is possible to discuss
            that in reality “The Second Bakery Attack” shows
            a deep reflection about different themes and symbols.

            <h3><i>Hunger</i></h3>
            <img src="icons/hunger.png" width="100">
            <p>
                In the first place, the hunger. The wife claims that
                it is a curse that the husband has brought upon her.
                It symbolises the need to complete unfinished
                business: in this case, the idea is that the man has not
                completed his robbery in the first attack, so the curse
                was on him to do it. It is also liked to the overwhelming
                desire for food, that drove the man and his wife
                to commit a crime and to the symbol of the volcano,
                representing the curse of the past.

            <img src="icons/past.png" width="100">
            <p>
                Another theme touched by Murakami is the boundary
                between the past and the present through
                the memory of the first bakery attack. The comparison
                between what was more and exchange rather than a
                robbery, the difference between the usage of weapons
                and the feelings that would remain afterwards. <br>
                The main character is experiencing a disconnection,
                a lack of balance between the past and the present and
                a contrast between his old values and his modern life. <br>
                This is symbolised by the boat and the water metaphor.

            <img src="icons/gender.png" width="100">
            <p>
                The story underlines also the reversion of stereotypes
                about gender roles: while the man seems very
                submissive, his wife is in control of the situation.
                She is insistent of robbing a bakery and when they can
                not find any, she is the one who suggest to robber
                a McDoonald's. <br> She seems prepared to what comes
                next, in contrast to her husband.

            <h3><i>Capitalism</i></h3>
            <img src="icons/capitalism.png" width="100">
            <p>
                The whole story represent a revolt against
                consumerism and capitalism, represented
                by McDonald's. The narrator felt this consumerist
                culture in the first robbery, when he had to listen
                to Wagner to earn the bread, and now he express
                his dislike for this. <br> Related to the future consumeristic
                culture that would explode in Japan, the narrator asks
                to his wife if the robbery was really necessary. <br>
                She replies that it was while falling asleep, leaving
                the man with his thoughts.

            <p>
                In correlation to these themes, “The Second Bakery
                Attack” underlines also a reflection about the future
                and the fact that nothing is in our control. <br>
                The introduction of the story contains the reflection
                of the narrator about why he told his wife about the
                first bakery attack. <br> Even if it is composed of just a few
                sentences, it is full of meaning and it also encourages
                the readers to interrogate themselves.<br>
                <br>
                <i>“I myself have adopted the position that, in fact, we
                never choose anything at all. Things happen. Or not.”</i>

        <h3>
            THE CONCEPT
          </h3>
          <p>
            I focused on two details of the story: <br>
            ▪ The sentence “we never choose anything at all.
            Things happen. Or not.” for the theoretical aspect<br>
            ▪ The McDonald's Burger for the practical aspect<br>
            <br>
            Following a research, I found out that the McDonald's
            employees have to follow a designed structure and
            protocol to produce their burgers. <br>
            In this case, in fact,
            the employees movements in the shop and their actions
            on the burgers are quite predictable.<br>
            However, Murakami's story underline how the right
            actions may produce wrong results and vice versa,
            because things aren't always what they seem, but they
            might change or they might mean something else.<br>
            So, I was questioning myself: what if the
            burger is not a real burger? <br>The story is composed by
            metaphors, so what if the burger would represent the
            user's life and each layer would be an experience that
            might occur? <br>
            Related to this reasoning, the final project consists in
            a physical burger and a virtual one, displayed on
            a computer screen. <br> The user has all the ingredients
            in front of him (the crown and the heel of the burger,
            the hamburger, the cheese, the onions and the pickles)
            and his goal is to assembly them in the right way,
            understanding the connection between the physical
            object and the one displayed. <br> That said, because as
            soon as he begin to stack one layer on to the other,
            he will realise that the physical thing does not
            correspond to the virtual one (e.g. the physical cheese
            may correspond to the displayed onions).<br> Only one
            combination of ingredients is correct, and every time
            that he fails, he is “reminded” of his helplessness
            in front of unexpected events with some sentences
            extrapolated from the story and displayed randomly.
